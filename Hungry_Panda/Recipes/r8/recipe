Bulgogi – Korean Beef BBQ (불고기) is probably one of the best known Korean Beef BBQ dish other than Kimchi. In this bulgogi recipe, I offer several substitutions and variations that you can try. They will all taste good but I think it is good to have options in case you don't have all the ingredients.
